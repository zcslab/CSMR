## Supervised Learning within Different Subspaces using Mixture Modeling

### Motivation

A tremendous amount of applications deal with relating a response variable to a set of covariates. The homogeneity assumption that the relation maintains for the entire population is often inadequate, when there exists complex subspace architecture in the data. Detection of all subspace domains comes with inhibitive computational cost. In this work, we proposed an efficient supervised subspace learning framework, which are particularly useful in detecting the dynamic dependencies between subsets of features and a response variable specific to unknown subspaces in the input data, namely **C**omponent **S**parse **M**ixture **R**egression (**CSMR**). We demonstrated CSMR to be very promising to deal with high dimensional data with complicated unknown subspace structures. Experimental evaluation on simulated benchmark data demonstrated that CSMR can accurately identify the subspaces on which subsets of features are explainable to the external variable. Application of CSMR on one real-world cancer cell line drug sensitivity data demonstrated that the subsets of feature and subspaces of subject identified by the proposed method have more favourable performances.
